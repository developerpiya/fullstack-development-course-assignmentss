    <div>
        <h3>The main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model is how they handle
            the arrangement and alignment of elements within a container. </h3>

        <h3>CSS Flexbox:</h3>

        <b>One-Dimensional Layout:</b> Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as a row or a column.
        It's ideal for arranging elements in a single direction, such as a horizontal row or a vertical column.

        <b>Content-Centric:</b> Flexbox is well-suited for situations where the content within the container has a
        dynamic size, and you want to align and distribute it based on its natural size. It's great for elements within
        a container to distribute space evenly along the main axis.

        <b>Flexibility:</b> It's excellent for building components like navigation bars, sidebars, and flexible content
        containers where the size of items can vary.

        <b>Alignment:</b> It provides powerful alignment options along the main axis and the cross-axis, allowing you to
        center content both horizontally and vertically.

        <h3>CSS Grid:</h3>

        Two-Dimensional Layout: Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, which means it can define both rows and
        columns in a grid. This makes it well-suited for laying out complex structures with rows and columns, such as
        tables or grids of items.

        <b> Layout Control:</b> Grid allows precise control over both the rows and columns. You can create fixed or
        flexible tracks and position items in any cell within the grid.

        <b>Grid Gaps:</b> Grid has built-in gap properties to control the spacing between rows and columns, which is
        useful for creating responsive and visually appealing layouts.

        <b>Grid-Aware:</b> Grid is aware of both the content and the container size, making it suitable for creating
        consistent layouts, especially when you have specific sizing requirements for rows and columns.

        <h3>When to Choose Flexbox or Grid:</h3>

        The choice between Flexbox and Grid depends on your layout requirements:

        <b>Use Flexbox when:</b>

        <ul>
            <li>You have a one-dimensional layout (row or column).</li>
            <li>You want to distribute space and align items along a single axis.</li>
            <li> Your content is dynamic, and you want elements to adapt to their natural size.
            </li>
            <li>
                You're building components like navigation bars or flexible content containers.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Use Grid when:</b>
        <li> You need a two-dimensional layout with rows and columns.
        </li>
        <li> You want precise control over the positioning and sizing of items within a grid.
        </li>
        <li> You're creating complex layouts, like magazine-style pages, forms, or grids of content.
        </li>
        <li> You need to align content both horizontally and vertically within the grid.
        </li>
        <li>In many cases, you can also combine both Flexbox and Grid within the same layout to take advantage of the
            strengths of each model for different aspects of your design</li>
