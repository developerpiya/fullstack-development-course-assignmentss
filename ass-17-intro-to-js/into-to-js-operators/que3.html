    <h1>Difference between unary, binary and ternary operator in JS with example ?</h1>
    <p>Unary Operator : In which we use operator upon one operand is called unary operator</p>
    <script>
        var a = 2;
        console.log(a++)
    </script>
    <p>Binary Operator : In which we use operator upon two operand is called unary operator</p>
    <script>
        var a = 2;
        var b = 2;
        console.log(a + b)
    </script>
    <p>Ternory Operator : In which we use operator upon three operand is called unary operator</p>
    <script>
        var a = 2;
        var b = 2;
        var c = 2;
        console.log(a + b + c)
    </script>
