    <h1>What is the purpose of declaring variables in js, and how do you declare them using the let keyword ?</h1>
    We use the variable for scope definig in which we use three types variables
    (1) var (globle scope)
    (2) let (block scope)
    (3) const (contant variable)

    <script>
        var a = 3;
        const c = 6;
        if (a) {
            let b = 4;
            console.log(b)
            console.log(a)
        }
        console.log(b);//Here give the console error bcz b value not found out of scope
        c = 8;
        console.log(c);//Here give the console error bcz can't change the value of constant variable.
    </script>
