    <p>Web design, also known as website design, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.

        Web design is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). The term design is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).</p>
