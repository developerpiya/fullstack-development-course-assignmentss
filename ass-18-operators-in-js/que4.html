    <h3>Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in js. Why is understanding these concept importat ? </h3>
    <p> <b>Precedence</b> Operator precedence determines how operators are parsed concerning each other. Operators with higher precedence become the operands of operators with lower precedence.</p>

    <p> <b>Associativity</b> The associativity of an operator specifies the order in which operations of the same precedence are performed. Left-to-right associativity means that operations are performed from left to right</p>
    <script>
        console.log(3 + (4**2));
        // here focus on the precedence dont care about the associativity
        console.log(3 * 4 +2)
        //here show the left to right associativity
    </script>
